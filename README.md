# pybaseballscraper
### Python baseball stats scraper

For fun project - practice Python, SQL, data analysis, and using git/github.

### Things to do:
- [X] Pitching and hitting modules need improvements :tada:  
- [X] Incorporate other stat sources - player salaries, advanced stats :tada:    
- [X] Investigate if the lag added during scraping does anything (prevents IP getting blocked, maybe?) :tada:  
- [ ] Exploratory notebook.
- [ ] While creating notebook I noticed the get_war function is not including the season data, needs to be added.
- [ ] When data sources are all sorted out create functions to search the data, possibly a front-end.
