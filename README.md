# pybaseballscraper
### Python baseball stats scraper

-- Added python files to scrape MLB stats data for pitching and hitting since 1876  
-- Each file take a good amount of time to run due to the artificial lag added  


### Things to do:
-- Pitching and hitting modules need improvements.  
-- Exploratory notebook.  
-- Incorporate other stat sources.  
-- Create a update module, to add new data added since last time program was run.
